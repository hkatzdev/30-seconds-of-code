Find the current rotate or rotateY value of an element in degrees.

- Uses `window.getComputedStyle()` and `CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyValue()` to get transform matrix.
- Calculates the current degree with `Math.atan2()` based off of the returned matrix.
- Returns a number from 0-360.
- Due to precision you may want to round the result.
- Does ***NOT*** work for rotateX (see comments for details).
- Dual Licened under CC0-1.0 or 0BSD.

```js
/**
 * Find the current rotate or rotateY value of an element in degrees.
 * @function currentRotation
 * @param {Element} element - The element to check the rotation of.
 * @returns {number} Returns the current rotation in degrees (from 0-360).
 */
const currentRotation = element => {
  const allStyles = window.getComputedStyle(element, null);
  const transformMatrix = allStyles.getPropertyValue('transform');
  // If the property is empty or set to none, then there is no rotation.
  if (transformMatrix === '' || transformMatrix === 'none') return 0;
  const flattenedMatrix = transformMatrix.split(/[(,]/);
  /*
   * Both rotate and rotateY have values that line up.
   * Unfortunetly, rotateX does not have any spots that line up.
   * Since it requires special detection rotateX is ***not*** supported.
   * For Reference:
   * rotate (Adeg) = matrix  ( cos(A), sin(A), -sin(A), cos(A), 0, 0       );
   * rotateY(Ydeg) = matrix3d( cos(Y), 0,      -sin(Y), 0,      0, 1,      ...
   * rotateX(Xdeg) = matrix3d( 1,      0,      0,       0,      0, cos(Y), ...
   */
  const arctan2 = Math.atan2(-flattenedMatrix[3], flattenedMatrix[1]);
  const arctan2Deg = arctan2 * 180 / Math.PI;
  /*
   * By default arctan2Deg will be between -180 to 180.
   * This is due to how arctan2 works (uses all 4 quadrants).
   * However, most likely 0-360 deg is expected.
   * Add 360 deg if arctan2Deg < 0
   */
  return arctan2Deg < 0 ? arctan2Deg + 360 : arctan2Deg;

```js
